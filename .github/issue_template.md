<!--

  Thank you for reporting a bug for the Cmder project!
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Please make sure you read and follow the following instructions
  before reporting bugs, and/or requesting new features.
  
  Make sure that you have:
  
  • Searched for existing issues (including the **closed** ones)
    for the similar problems here:
    https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues?q=is:issue
    
  • Read the README.md and the Wiki:
    - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md
    - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki
    
    (What you may be asking here could already be explained there!)
    
  • Please understand that Cmder by default uses ConEmu as the
    underlying Terminal Emulator. If your issue is regarding
    the **Terminal Emulator**, please visit the ConEmu issues page:
    
    https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues?q=is:issue
    
    If there isn't an existing issue, you may open a new one.
    
    (We don't resolve issues regarding ConEmu here, so please 
     make sure you open the issue in the correct place.)
     
  • If you are asking for Guides on how to integrate Cmder into
    your favorite IDE of choice, or how to perform an specific
    task with Cmder, make sure you visit our Guides section first:
    
    - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues?q=label:Guide
    - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues?q=label:Question
     
  • If the issue is regarding the other upstream technologies that
    Cmder uses (e.g. Clink, Git, etc), please make sure that the
    bug you are reporting only applies when they are used in
    combination with Cmder. If the bug applies when the mentioned
    tools are NOT used within Cmder, there's a good chance that
    you should open the bug at the corresponding repo instead.
    
    
  Thank you for making sure you are opening a new valid issue!
